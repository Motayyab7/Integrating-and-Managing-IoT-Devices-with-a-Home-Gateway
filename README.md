Overview
-
I set up and configured a home gateway to manage a network of various devices, including IoT and Bluetooth devices. I connected and integrated these devices, ensuring proper communication and monitoring through the home gateway, while gaining practical skills in networking, IP addressing, device configuration, and network security. I dealt with different varieties of devices and made them all work together on a home network. Here is the summary of key skills and knowledge acquired:

Home Gateway Integration
-

Learned how to add and configure a home gateway into a network environment by connecting with a cable modem that may act as a central device in managing the network traffic.

Addition and Configuration of End-User Devices
-

I added a wireless tablet to the network and learned how to connect to cellular and Wi-Fi networks from that device. I looked into the process of switching between those and configuring the tablet to connect specifically to the home Wi-Fi network.

Disconnecting and Managing Network Services
-

I practiced turning off and on the internet services on the tablet and checked for connectivity through the home gateway's IoT server. It helped me understand how to administer and test network connections.

IoT device connection and configuration
-

I practiced connecting various IoT devices like lamps, fans, and doors to both wired and wireless networks. I learned how to configure these devices to register themselves with the home gateway's IoT server so they would receive appropriate IP addresses and list properly on the IoT server.

IoT Device Monitoring and Management
-

I learned how to use the IoT Monitor on a tablet to view and control IoT devices. Checking device registration, viewing details of devices, and performing operations on devices via the IoT server front-end was done. 

Bluetooth Device Integration
-

I added a Bluetooth speaker and a portable music player into the network and configured them as such. I have also learned how to enable Bluetooth connectivity, pair devices, and ensure they communicate effectively over the network.

Advanced Device Configuration
-

I configured advanced settings, such as setting up IoT devices that have specified settings and making sure that they had been appropriately registered on the IoT server. This experience gave me further insight into the management and configuration of networked devices.

Practical Troubleshooting
-

Troubleshooting skills have been developed through solving connectivity problems of the devices to the network, IP address allocation, and registration on the network. This helped me understand how common network-related problems could be diagnosed and rectified.

Summary
-

This project enabled me with practical skills in the configuration of a network, integration of devices, and management of the different types of networked devices. It improved my understanding of how to set up and then maintain a home network supporting both wired and wireless connections, IoT devices, and Bluetooth peripherals.
