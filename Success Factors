Through this project, I got to know how to configure a home gateway to serve as the central device in my network. I could now, therefore, connect a number of devices, both wired and wireless and Bluetooth, to the network and configure them to communicate with the home gateway.

I learned IP addressing and how devices acquire the IP addresses in a network and make use of them. I have also learned the integration of other IoT devices such as lamps, fans, doors, into my network and how they can be made to connect to the home gateway properly.

During the process, I learned how to administer a wireless networkâ€”configuration of devices onto a home Wi-Fi network and dealing with devices that have cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity. I have also been taught how to pair and configure Bluetooth devices and how they interact with each other on a network.

I set up an IoT server, from which the connected devices could be monitored and managed. This learning contained device control and interaction via the IoT monitor application. I learned practical troubleshooting skills to resolve connectivity issues and used tools like Fast Forward Time to expedite network configuration tasks.

Moreover, I did the network security by configuring usernames and passwords to access devices._device configuration interfaces helped me to learn how to navigate and use the different tabs and settings in a user interface. By following up on this project, I will be better prepared for greater challenges in networking and IoT.
